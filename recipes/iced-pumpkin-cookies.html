            <h3>Icing Ingredients</h3>

                <li>2 Cups Confectioners' Or Powdered Sugar</li>
                <li>3 Tablespoons Milk</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Melted Butter</li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
           
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 Degrees F, or 175 Degrees C and grease 2 cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and salt into a medium bowl in order to prepare the cookie mixture.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and butter into a mixing bowl and make a fluffy cream; this should take around 2-3 minutes. Add egg, vanilla, and pumpkin to the mixture and beat until it is creamy. Mix this into the flour mixture and add tablespoonfuls of this dough onto the cookie sheets. Flatten the dough slightly.</li>
            <li>Bake until the cookies are set, which should take around 15-20 minutes. Switch racks halfway through and afterwards, transfer the cookies to a wire rack so they can cool.</li>
            <li>To make the icing, stir milk, butter, vanilla, and confectioners' sugar in a bowl until it is smooth and slowly add milk as needed. The goal is a drizzling consistency.</li>
            <li>Drizzle icing over the cookies, preferably with a fork.</li>

        </ol>
