                <li>3 Tablespoons Milk</li>
                <li>1 Tablespoon Melted Butter</li>
                <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
           
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>To make the cookies: Combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Cream together sugar and butter in a mixing bowl until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add pumpkin, egg, and vanilla; beat until creamy. Mix in flour mixture until combined. Drop tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared cookie sheets; flatten slightly.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until centers are set, 15 to 20 minutes, switching racks halfway through. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the icing: Stir together confectioners' sugar, milk, butter, and vanilla in a bowl until smooth. Add milk as needed, to achieve drizzling consistency.</li>
            <li>Drizzle icing over cooled cookies with a fork.</li>

        </ol>
