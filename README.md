This project will display a couple of recipes. It's purpose is to practice HTML and CSS!

This project was great in helping reinforce what I learned in the Foundation lessons of The Odin Project! I got to utilize everything, from typing out the HTML boilerplate to organizing code into appropriate sections such as unordered and ordered lists where they were called for. One of the main takeaways from the project in my opinion was learning how to upload to and actually run the project with Github.

It was fun!
